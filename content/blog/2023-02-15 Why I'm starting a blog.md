Welcome to my new blog! I'm glad you're here. The purpose of this blog is to capture interesting idea's and/or solutions especially for myself to build a digital archive. But I might capture experiences or know things that are worth sharing with the world. I hope you'll find it useful and interesting.

I plan to write about a variety of topics, including:

- GitHub
- Azure DevOps
- Azure
- PowerShell
- Integrations
- Home Automation
- and more fun things that I encounter when I'm wandering of in the digital area!
